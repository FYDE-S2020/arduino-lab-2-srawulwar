## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    The 32-bit IP address is unique to each machine and thus acts as its interface identification

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A DNS is a lookup service. IP addresses are hard to remember and thus a DNS maps a symbolic name to its corresponding IP address. 

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    When a device has a static IP, the address does not change. Dynamic IP are assigned by the network when the device connects and change over time. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP provides reliable communication while UDP provides fast communication

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event based and using a delay function will mess up the timing.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    This means nothing else can run when this function is runnng

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts have a higher priority than the function and can pause that function's task to complete the interrupt function.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   An interface defines how a function is called while implementation describes what it actually does. It is important because there are multiple implementations for a function that has been interfaced and we can choose ourselves how to implement.
